# NextStep AI — Member B evidence layer

Run Member A from `backend/`, then from this directory install `requirements.txt` and run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001`. POST a `StudentProfile` to `/analyze`.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and place the real Gemini credential in `ai-rag/.env` as `GEMINI_API_KEY=...`. Never commit that file. `HashEmbeddingService` is a deterministic offline development/test provider; production should replace it with a semantic `EmbeddingService` implementation configured by `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`.

The service never changes Member A. It calls `/match`, retains its complete result set, and only selects `Eligible` rows for the MVP Top 3. Scores and eligibility remain separate response fields from AI prose and retrieved evidence.

## Analysis response contract

`POST /analyze` returns the frontend presentation contract from `app/presentation.py`: `profile_summary`, up to three `top_scholarships`, `partial_matches`, and `application_roadmap`. The internal `AnalysisResponse` still carries scores, evidence, and provider diagnostics for pipeline use, but those fields are not exposed by the normal HTTP response.

`deadline` is copied from Member A's normalized `Opportunity.deadline_raw`; missing values remain `null` in the frontend response. `document_checklist` is derived only from retrieved excerpts that explicitly name documents. Otherwise it is `{ "status": "unavailable", "items": [], "note": "Not available from the official source" }`. Gemini output is validated as `why_this_match` plus a non-empty `actions` list before either is used. Gemini requests have a 30-second timeout and one short retry by default; these are configurable with `GEMINI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `GEMINI_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`.

Gap scope is intentionally broader than the recommendation list: `gaps` may include actionable shortfalls from any `Partial Match` returned by Member A, even when three `Eligible` recommendations exist. This gives the roadmap profile-improvement context. Partial Match opportunities are never inserted into `recommendations`; that list remains the top three `Eligible` results from `top_three_eligible()`.

The presentation response shows at most five partial matches, ordered by the existing opportunity-level `total_score`. Member A computes scores for both `Eligible` and `Partial Match` opportunities; those partial scores are valid fit scores, not eligibility guarantees. If a partial result has no score breakdown, its presentation `match_score` is `null` rather than an unrelated fallback value.

Actions are requested from Gemini as opportunity-specific, evidence- and score-grounded next steps. The mocked test client intentionally returns a simple name-substituted response to exercise schema flow; it is not representative of Gemini's prose quality. The current implementation validates presence and structure, but does not semantically guarantee that two LLM action lists are meaningfully different.

## Source identity and limitations

Member A's `/match` response supplies `source_url` from the same normalized opportunity it evaluated. Member B does not read Member A's workbook. Shared URLs are fetched once per ingestion operation but chunk metadata is stamped with an opportunity ID; retrieval enforces that ID and active source version, so shared hub-page chunks cannot cross into another opportunity's evidence.

`ChromaVectorStore` uses persistent Chroma when available at `CHROMA_PATH`, while retaining an in-memory fallback for zero-service tests. No Chroma API leaks above this layer.
